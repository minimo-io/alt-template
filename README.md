# ALT template
Minimo's core template for products, one with an absolute focus on content.
Responsible father of the [ALT. Wordpress template](https://github.com/minimo-io/alt-wordpress-theme).

The theme was developed to be in tune with [Mínimo’s design principles](https://minimo.io/en/manifest/).
We set out to create a template that would get out of the way. Avoiding interruptions, and focused on delivering a beautiful reading experience.
